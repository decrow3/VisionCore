"""Extract the single-unit-readout network icon straight out of
ssi_figure_v2_3.pdf's Panel A -- the Illustrator-fixed reference artwork --
instead of continuing to hand-tune generate_ssi_figure_v2.draw_model_icon's
matplotlib reproduction of it.

The reference draws this icon once per row (FEM jittered / stabilized) at
identical geometry, just translated vertically; both instances were checked
by eye and are pixel-identical, so only the first (FEM) row is extracted and
reused for both rows in the v3 composite. It also includes an entry arrow
(cube -> network) that generate_ssi_figure_v2.draw_model_icon never drew, so
using the extracted version is a strict improvement over the matplotlib
reproduction, not just a style change.

Bounding box (`ICON_BBOX_PT`, PDF points, origin top-left of the page) was
measured by hand against this file's own vector drawings/text spans -- see
the exploration in this session -- padded by ~1-2pt on each side.

Does NOT extract the movie-cube icon: unlike the network diagram, the cube
already renders real per-run stimulus/trace data via
declan/fig_ssi/make_ssi_contour_schematic.add_visual_model_input_cube, so
freezing it to this one reference PDF's snapshot would silently discard that
per-run data instead of copying a purely-illustrative asset.

Run: uv run python declan/fig/ssi_figure_v2/panels/extract_panel_a_network_icon.py
